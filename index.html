            Hello frineds, my name is Kaiden Munsey and I am 28 years old. I currently live in Brooksville Florida, which is a small town an hour North of Tampa. I am a huge fan of all animals but especially dogs, I have a Pitbull mix of my own named Chase. On my free time I enjoy being outside, from yard work to sitting and relaxing on my porch.
             Currently I am an Executive Chef at a retirement home here in Brooksville called The Grande; I have worked here for ten years and have been the Chef for six. This has been my only job, as I started right out of high school in 2009 as a server. I learned everything there was to be taught in a short four years, making my way up to eventually running the entire kitchen department.
             
            Music is a big part of my life; anything from heavy Metal Dubstep to classic Jazz, you can always find me listening to music. Being a creative person I  challenge myself om what I am capable of producing and that is the main interest I have of becoming a Web Developer.
